        Hey There,
      </p>
      <p>
        Author of longtweet here! Before you get in to the weeds of the
        templated policy statement, I want to give you the gist:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>We don’t use cookies.</li>
        <li>We don’t use trackers of any kind.</li>
        <li>There are no ads and no other 3rd party services.</li>
        <li>
          In order to log you into this web app, we use the Twitter API. At at
          minimum, Twitter gives developers the ability to read tweets and other
          basic profile information. We will never use this ability and if we
          could give up that ability, we would.
        </li>
        <li>
          The only info we do collect is the result of server logs which contain
          anonymized IP addresses and service access times.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, we try <em>not</em> to collect any information on you at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>
          Simplicity and transparency is the appeal and identity of this service
          and that will never change.
